        To make Papa Franku's Signiture ravioli, this is what you need to do. This will make you the best ravioli you will ever eat. Once upon a time, there was a land where noone ate anything but what the king told them too. 
        There was a fire nation made up of vigilanties for the revolution. 
        And then the fire nation attacked.... the fire nation and the capital got in a heated battle. 
        The only food item that remained after the world was destroyed was ravioli. And that my friends is how ravioli was made.

        <li>Place all of the ravioli ingredients into a small sauce pan,except the wonton wrappers, and turn the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cook the meat for about <i>10 minutes</i>, or until browned; you much stir this constantly and sometimes vigorously to keep the mixture smooth, no lumps!</li>
        <li>Wet the edges of a wonton wrapper and place 1-1 1/2 tablespoons of the meat mixture in the center; top with another wonton skin and press all of the air out of the ravioli while you are pressing the edges together to make a tight seal.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Place all of the sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan except the cheese and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the ravioli to the boiling water and boil them, stirring occasionally for <i>5-8 minutes</i>.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and add the cheddar cheese and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Toss the ravioli and sauce together in a large bowl and serve.</li>
