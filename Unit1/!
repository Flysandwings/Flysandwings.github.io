      <p>To make Papa Franku's Signiture ravioli, this is what you need to do.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Place all of the ravioli ingredients into a small sauce pan,except the wonton wrappers, and turn the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cook the meat for about <i>10 minutes</i>, or until browned; you much stir this constantly and sometimes vigorously to keep the mixture smooth, no lumps!</li>
        <li>Wet the edges of a wonton wrapper and place 1-1 1/2 tablespoons of the meat mixture in the center; top with another wonton skin and press all of the air out of the ravioli while you are pressing the edges together to make a tight seal.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Place all of the sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan except the cheese and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the ravioli to the boiling water and boil them, stirring occasionally for <i>5-8 minutes</i>.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and add the cheddar cheese and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Toss the ravioli and sauce together in a large bowl and serve.</li>
      </ol>
